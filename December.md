<h1>December 3rd:</h1>
<p>-created a Canva for planning and brainstorming</p>

<p>-Spent time thinking up ideas and planning for what our game can include and be about!!</p>
<p>-tried to find examples of games that are similar to our ideas...</p>

<h1>December 5:</h1>
<p>-didn't do any work in class because my computer was dead (worked on other homework...)</p>
<p>-made up for my lack of work at home</p>
<p>-started installing the things I need to set up the shared GitHub stuff that Ayla had figured out earlier this week</p>
<p>-downloaded GitHub for desktop</p>
<p>-I started downloading git but got stuck/confused at one point, so I plan on asking others in the class who have already done it for help...</p>
<p>-did a bit of research on version control and connecting GitHub to Godot and how that actually works</p>
<p>-I watched a few videos (link's below) that gave me some general knowledge about it, but I would still like to know more as it is confusing to me...</p>
<p>-I find it very confusing because of how different each godot version is, so it's hard to know which tutorial/video works for us now with the current version...</p>

<h1>December 6th:</h1>
<p>-finished downloading git for my computer (realized the thing that was confusing me didn't even need to be done!!)</p>
<p>-LP helped to set up the clone of the 40S Game GitHub repository for my GitHub desktop!! (code<>, open w/ desktop GitHub)</p>
<p>-figured out that it was already connected to Godot (stuff I did before!!) </p>
<p>-tested out pushing new stuff from Godot to the github by using the GitHub desktop and all of that and it worked!!!</p>
<p>-we started brainstorming questions to ask Matt as we were conserned about version history and keeping track of stuff like that...</p>

<h1>December 10th:</h1>
<p>-we finished up thinking of some questions for Matt</p>
<p>-We tried to start making a list of deliverables but were having trouble since we were 100% sure on our game idea yet</p>
<p>-we then kept designing and planning out and thinking about our game idea</p>
