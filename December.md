<h1>December 3rd:</h1>
<p>-created a Canva for planning and brainstorming</p>
<p>-https://www.canva.com/design/DAGYQa6fBUg/nuOJ0Y3RBRLQtY4XfkNngQ/edit?utm_content=DAGYQa6fBUg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton</p>
<p>-Spent time thinking up ideas and planning for what our game can include and be about!!</p>
<p>-tried to find examples of games that are similar to our ideas...</p>

<h1>December 5:</h1>
<p>-didn't do any work in class because my computer was dead (worked on other homework...)</p>
<p>-made up for my lack of work at home</p>
<p>-started installing the things I need to set up the shared GitHub stuff that Ayla had figured out earlier this week</p>
<p>-downloaded GitHub for desktop</p>
<p>-I started downloading git but got stuck/confused at one point, so I plan on asking others in the class who have already done it for help...</p>
<p>-did a bit of research on version control and connecting GitHub to Godot and how that actually works</p>
<p>-I watched a few videos (link's below) that gave me some general knowledge about it, but I would still like to know more as it is confusing to me...</p>
<p>-I find it very confusing because of how different each godot version is, so it's hard to know which tutorial/video works for us now with the current version...</p>
