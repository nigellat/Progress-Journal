<h1>December 5:</h1>
<p>-didn't do any work in class because my computer was dead (worked on other homework...)</p>
<p>-made up for my lack of work at home</p>
<p>-started installing the things I need to set up the shared GitHub stuff that Ayla had figured out earlier this week</p>
<p>-downloaded GitHub for desktop</p>
<p>-I started downloading git but got stuck/confused at one point, so I plan on asking others in the class who have already done it for help...</p>
<p>-did a bit of research on version control and connecting GitHub to Godot and how that actually works</p>
<p>-watched a few vide'so (link's below) that gave me some general knowledge about it but I would still like to know more as its confusing to me...</p>
