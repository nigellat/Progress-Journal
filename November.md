<h1>November 26th:</h1>
<p>-I started creating first game on my own (want to make snake) </p>
<p>-Downloaded snake assets from a fork of the original GitHub from a YouTube video I found  (https://github.com/nigellat/Snake_in_Godot/tree/main/SnakeProject)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I_AdBkryoU</p>
<p>-Today, I created the new file and searched for free assets online for a snake game and then downloaded them from the links above!</p>
<p>-For next time, I plan on getting the rest of my space in Godot organized and making sure I understand what's what and then start creating the background and the snake character</p>
<p>-My overall goal is to try and make the game on my own and play around with the actual coding part and Godot in general since there is so much going on, and I want to be able to know how to do at least the simple things like creating backgrounds and a simple character on my own...</p>
<p>-I will most likely use the video tutorial as a base to help me when I'm stuck; however, otherwise, I want to try and do it entirely on my own!</p>

<h1>November 28th:</h1>
<p>-continued to work on my game and followed only with that video tutorial I found</p>
<p>-struggled to add the assets into the Godot file and had to follow the first tutorial video we watched that we all followed along to figure it out...</p>

<h1>November 29th:</h1>
<p>-worked on other class work during the class but made up for it by doing an hour of computer science at home over the weekend</p>
<p>-I did a bit of world-building to create the snake backdrop!</p>
