<h1>October 4th:</h1>
<p>-I started following along and watching the "How to Make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial" YouTube video</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0</p>
<p>-I got to about 17 minutes into the 1 hour and 17 minute video</p>
<p>-I learnt about how to set up a new file in Godot and how to set up everything to start making a beginner video game</p>
<p>-this all wasn't too complicated. It may just take me a bit of time to get used to using the new learning environment and remember how to do everything within Godot</p>

<h1>October 9th:</h1>
<p>-continued to work on the GDScript video tutorial, got to about 23 minutes into the video</p>
<p>-I had an issue with one of my platforms not working, but I quickly realized I had forgotten to put the one-sided collision detection onto it!</p>
<p>I plan to finish the rest of the video this weekend to catch up on some of the classes I have missed/wasn't able to work since my computer was dead</p>
