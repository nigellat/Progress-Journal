<h1>October 4th:</h1>
<p>-I started following along and watching the "How to Make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial" YouTube video</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0</p>
<p>-I got to about 15 minutes into the 1 hour and 17 minute video</p>
<p>-I learnt about how to set up a new file in Godot and how to set up everything to start making a beginner video game</p>
<p>-I learnt about assets and how Godot works, as well as learn about how to create a player and do a bit of worldbuilding for a game</p>
<p>-this all wasn't too complicated. It may just take me a bit of time to get used to using the new learning environment and remember how to do everything within Godot</p>

<h1>October 9th:</h1>
<p>-continued to work on the GDScript video tutorial, got to about 30 minutes into the video</p>
<p>-I had an issue with one of my platforms not working, but I quickly realized I had forgotten to put the one-sided collision detection onto it!</p>
<p>-I learnt about platforms and how to make them in Godot </p>
<p>I plan to finish the rest of the video this weekend to catch up on some of the classes I have missed/wasn't able to work since my computer was dead</p>

<h1>October 10th:</h1>
<p>-I continued watching and following along with the video tutorial (I did this on my own time to make up for classes I missed!!!)</p>
<p>-I completed the follow along video </p>
<p>-I learnt about how to do pickups with coins for a player in a basic game, how to deal with "dying" players, more worldbuilding, how to create an enemy, how to add text, a score, and audio to the game, and how to export the game to save it all!!!) </p>
<p>-Doing a majority of the video tutorial all at once was a lot for my brain to handle, but it was all pretty straightforward besides my few learning curves</p>
<p>-One of my "learning curves" was when I added in coins for the player to pick up when I would play the game. They started to move in the same motion as one of the moving platforms I had made prior. I realized this happened because I had added the coins in under the platform node(?), and so it had the animation added to it as well. To fix it, I moved the coin nodes above the platform nodes, and then it worked as I needed it to!! </p>
<p> I figured out how to export the game to my desktop and successfully created my first game!! </p>
<p>-I think for next time, I will have to go back into my first game and see what I've done or look up other references or tutorials, but the more I use and get used to Godot, the easier it will be as besides a few silly mistakes, my only issues with godot have been not being used to it or familiar with how to use it yet!</p>

<h1>October 15th:</h1>
<p>-watched the videos provided by LP, took notes in one note (learnt what waterfall is and reviewed how Agile(Scrum) works</p>
<p>-we use a form of agile for robotics, so it seems more familiar and also, due to group size and the opportunities for collaboration, we decided to use that over waterfall</p>
<p>-decided on some dates for the timeline. We wanted some time to play around and figure out Godot a bit more, so we took that into consideration within our timeline before we start actually start the design process(start the backlog)</p>

<h1>October 29th:</h1>
<p>-LP gave us an explanation of the new language portfolio and we looked at Janets example </p>
<p>-I started making my new language portfolio (made a cava and got it organized!!)</p>
