<h1>September 6th:</h1>
<p>-set up my progress journal</p>
<p>-decided the environment (Godot), language (C#), and what we're learning through (Codeacademy)</p>
<p>-downloaded the resources needed (Godot, C# extension for Visual Studio Code</p>

<h1>September 10th:</h1>
<p>-we decided to use gd script instead</p>
<p>-started the "Learn GDScript From Zero" tutorial app thing</p>
<p>link for website mentioned above: https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/?ref=godot-docs</p>
<p>-we plan to finish the Learn GDScript From Zero lessons within the next two weeks, I think??</p>
<p>-looked for and found extra resources as well</p>
<p>https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/?ref=godot-docs</p>

<h1>September 12th:</h1>
<p>-continued working on the Learn GDScript From Zero lessons</p>
<p>-currently I am up to lesson 9/27</p>
<p>-so far, the lessons feel like a review just on variables, functions, and the basics with slightly different syntax!</p>

<h1>September 20th:</h1>
<p>-continued working on the lessons</p>
<p>-currently on lesson 15/27 </p>
<p>-so far, it felt like review again just on variables, functions, the basics (again) </p>
<p>-I plan on starting to take notes for the language this weekend so that I can have that as a resource later on in the year</p>

<h1>September 24th:</h1>
<p>-continued working on the lessons</p>
<p>-currently on lesson 20/27</p>
<p>-reviewed vectors and vector components as well as using while and for loops (same as before, just different syntax and such)</p>
<p>-found a gdScript reference that might be good (haven't looked at it fully yet tho)</p>
<p>https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html</p>

<h1>September 29th:</h1>
<p>-I didn't have class today, but I finally made up the work for the two classes where my computer was dead/I was sick</p>
<p>-I finished the Learn to Code from Zero lessons (27/27!)</p>
<p>-learned more about different types of variables and how they work together (very similar to what I already know with Java) </p>
<p>-learnt what a dictionary is: a collection of key-value pairs, where each unique key maps to a specific value.</p>
<p>-once again, everything is very similar to what I already know with my previous coding experience, just with different syntax</p>
